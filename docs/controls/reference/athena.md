### CTL.ATHENA.ENCRYPT.001

**Athena Workgroups Must Encrypt Query Results**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** encryption
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SC-28; soc2: CC6.7;

Athena workgroups must encrypt query results at rest. Unencrypted query results in S3 expose data extracted by SQL queries.

**Remediation:** Enable encryption in the workgroup result configuration.
